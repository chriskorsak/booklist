## Description

This book list application is a project from [Modern Javascript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning) on Udemy. The application was written in two syntax styles. app.js uses Javascript ES5 object prototype syntax, and appes6.js uses ES6 class syntax, for a cleaner, more organized file. This application incorporates DOM manipulation, and also uses browser local storage to persist data.

Additionally, this application uses a CSS boilerplate framework called [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) to create the user interface. This application is fully responsive to all screen sizes.
